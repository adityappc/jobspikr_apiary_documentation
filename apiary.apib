# jobspikr


Jobspikr API helps you interact and use the data provided by Jobspikr. There are two APIs here, first is the "Job Search API" and 
the other is "Job Status API" . Job search API helps you search for jobs based on various criteria and the Job status API helps you check 
if a particular job given to you earlier is still still live and posted on the parent website.

This document covers the concepts related to API, its usage and some illustrative examples. It illustrates various use case. For help with 
specific queries, you may also check our query buidler helper at TODO https://app.jobspikr.com/organizations/mycompany2/query_builder


## Concepts

Details on some of the concepts to better use our API. 
### API URL and API KEY

Our regular end point is https://api.jobspikr.com/v2 . In case of persistent issues, you may also use https://api-bcp.jobspikr.com/v2 
as the fallback. To interact with the API, you need API key. Which can be gotten from the link https://app.jobspikr.com/my/?? . 
You'll see two keys. First is for sandbox and other one is for production. Data obtainted via sandbox is not paid, whereas one using the
production key is reduced from your available credit.

### Authentication
The Jobspikr API uses API keys to authenticate your requests. You can view and manage your API keys here. TODO

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your client_id as username and client_auth_key as password in the basic auth to authenticate your requests.
While making GET or POST request, you may also pass these fields in header with the field name client_id and client_auth_key and authentication will work as long as values are correct :)
### Job credit

Job credit is a way for us to measure usage from billing point of view. Each job from production key _downloaded_ or _retrieved via api_ 
counts towards credit. Jobs accessed from the sandbox don't count towards anything . Sanbox jobs are generally old and ver small subset
mainly to test the API and itegration.


## API Query and Result Data format

All the input and params passed to the API should be in UTF-8 and in json format. Response can be either in JSON(defualt) or XML format.
Response will always have two fields "status" and "message" . Other fields in the response might vary depending upon the query type and will 
be described later in this document.

### Cursor in API Query  for pagination

Our API supports cursor. Which is primarily a mechanism to enable records in smaller chunks when overall number of records is too
high.
How to use the cursor?
Send a request with/without cursor. (TODO in the first request how do you send cursor ?)
Take the next_cursor value from the response.
Use it as the value for cursor argument in the next request body.
Repeat this unless you get ‘status’:‘no_data’ to consume all the data for the query.



## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I be charged for duplicate job downloads

Even though you might receive same records if you run same query multiple times or across different queries,(correctly), you might get the same 
job records. You'll be charged only for unique records. As of now , counter in the dashboard at TODO shows currently aggregate fetched records either via
API or file download and we run the deduplication process for the counts every 1 hour.

### What is the period in which job credits is counted and duplicates ignored

Job credits and ignoring of duplicate fetches either via API or file download , runs for each monthly billing period TODO. After which these are reset.

### I am getting too many results for my queries

This happens if your queries are too generic. We suggest you try to restrict the search term, post dates or location to get specific results. 
Some of these cases are explained in example below. Please go over them and if issue still persists please reach out to us on support channel or
reach out to your account manager.

### Where can I get more details about search query json 

Right here :) This field is basically what is supported by ES TODO
Search query json basically supports lucene query syntax. That way elasticsearch Query syntax will work here TODO. In our example section we have shared some illustrative
examples and encourage you to try out whichever is closest to your requirement and play around with it TODO here are the examples for term query, boolean,range query etc. In case you still feel, more help is needed, please reach out to our
support or your dedicated account manager.


### Where can I get more details job schema that you give

TODO give link to definitive schema



##  Troubleshooting

Some of the common issues which developers have faced in past.

### I am getting only old records

### My key is not workign

## Details of the Search API [/data]

### Job Search Using GET Requests [GET]

This end point is the workhorse of the API.  backbone of API can Regular job searches. Please note that even though this is a GET request, even the POST request gives 
the same result. Which we have illustrated later

Fields in Request Header
- client_id (string) - This is your client id which can be obtained from here TODO The question
- client_auth_key (string) - Client auth key can be obtained from here TODO. Please use sandbox key for testing and production key for the actual key so that your job credits are not lost in testing


Fields in Request Body

- search_query_json (String,REQUIRED) - Search query generated by you for which the data will be returned. This search query string takes a JSON object as input. To know more about how to construct the search query please read this or explore our query builder.

- size (String,OPTIONAL)-  The number of records to be returned for this request. It can be between 10 and 100. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 100. Size should not be a part of search query json and should be always sent separately as mentioned here.

- format (String,OPTIONAL) - The format of the respone from API. It can be either 'json' or 'xml'. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 'json'.

- cursor (String,OPTIONAL) - This for pagination. API response can contain a maximum of 100 records but if there are 2000 records present and to get everything, you can use this cursor argument. This argument should not be a part of search query json and should always be sent separately as mentioned here.
    
    _How to use the cursor?_ - Send a request with/without cursor. Take the next_cursor value from the response. Use it as the value for cursor argument in the next request body.
    Repeat this unless you get ‘status’:‘no_data’ to consume all the data for the query.



Fields in Response Body



Depending upon whether 'json' or 'xml' was passed in format field of query,  A JSON or XML object will be returned all the following properties.

- status - The status of the response. It can be either these three
    
    _'success'_, if the request is processed successfully and data is returned.

    _'no_data'_ in case request is processes successfully but there is no more data present for the given query.

    _'error'_ in case of the some problem with processing the request.

- message -  The message explaining the status of the response.
- total_count - Number of records present for the query in request. If this number is more than 100 or the size specified in the request, you can use the next_cursor in subsequent request to get all the data.
- next_cursor - The cursor to be used in the next resquest to get the subsequent data for the query.
- size - Number of records  present in the current response
- job_credit_remaining -  Number of job data that is left to be consumed as per the plan subscription.
- job_data - An array of objects of job data. Format could be json or xml, depending upon what was passed in the format field in query

# Group Aggregation API

Description of the aggregation API

## Aggregation API EndPoint [/aggregate_data]

### Retrieve Aggregate Data [GET]

In the example below we'll illustrate the API params as well as an example to aggregate job query ''technical write' to aggregate by company name and country. Like other end points in jobspikr, here too GET and POST both request types will work. Later In the POST example ,we'll illustrate' aggregation by company name and post date
Fields in Request Header

- client_id (string) - This is your client id which can be obtained from here TODO The question
- client_auth_key (string) - Client auth key can be obtained from here TODO. Please use sandbox key for testing and production key for the actual key so that your job credits are not lost in testing

Fields in Request Body

- search_query_json (String,REQUIRED) - Search query generated by you for which the data will be returned. This search query string takes a JSON object as input. To know more about how to construct the search query please read this or explore our query builder. In case of aggregate API, instead of returning the job data for this request, the given aggregation will be applied on top of this query.
- aggregate_by (String,REQUIRED) - The json which instructs the API to aggregate based on the fields provided. Two levels of aggregation are possible



Some notes w.r.t aggregate_by parameter

- ‘field_1’ mentions the field on top of which the top level aggregation should be done on.
- ‘size_1’ mentions the number of aggregated results that should be returned form the API for top level aggregation.
- field_2 mentions the field on top of which the sub aggregation should be done on.
- ‘size_2’ mentions the number of aggregated results that should be from api for sub aggregation.
Please note that field_1 or field_2 must be from the following list - ‘company_name’, ‘inferred_country’, ‘post_date’ and If the field parameter is ‘post_date’ then ‘size’ parameter is not required, instead ‘interval’ parameter should be used(value for 'interval' can only be month or quarter
W.r.t size.  size parameters(size_1, size_2) when used can’t go above 10000.  If only one level of aggregation is used size_1 should be  <= 10000 If two level of aggregations are used size_1 + (size_1 * size_2) should be <= 10000
